# hello-world
Learning how to GitHub. So I made this, as per the tutorial.

## A bit about me
I am a university student studying chemistry and physics at Durham University in the UK. I mostly code for fun, although occasionaly need to do a bit for my course. I code exclusively in python but have dabbled in website stuff before and so know a bit of HTML, CSS and javascript. Topics I am interested in at the moment include:
- Deep learning and neural networks
- Any interesting application of coding in physics or chemistry
- Physics simulations
- Rasperry Pis and Arduinos

But anyway... I might update this later...
